influxd-restore(1)
==================

NAME
----
influxd-restore - Uses backups from the PATH to restore the metastore, databases, retention policies, or specific
 shards.  Default mode requires the instance to be stopped before running, and will wipe all databases from the
 system (e.g., for disaster recovery).  The improved online and enterprise modes requires the instance to be running,
 and the database name used must not already exist.
