# StringUp: Golang Extension Library for Strings!

`StringUp` is a micro-package that has some useful string functionality for your Golang Project.  Current Functions:

  + `CamelCase` - converts strings to their camel case equivalent
    + Example: `this is it` => `thisIsIt`, `this\_is\_it` => `thisIsIt`, `this-is-it` => `thisIsIt`

More work is being done...Kind of using this a dumping ground for string functions that I need in other projects
