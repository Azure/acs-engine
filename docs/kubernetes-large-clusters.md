# Large Kubernetes Clusters with acs-engine

## Background
Starting from acs-engine v0.3.0, acs-engine supports using exponential cloud backoff that is a feature of Kubernetes v1.6.6 and newer. Cloud backoff allows Kubernetes nodes to backoff on HTTP 429 errors that are usually caused by exceeding Azure API limits.

## To Use
Declare your kubernetes cluster API model config as you normally would, with the following requirements:
- You must be using at minimum the `v1.6.6` version of Kubernetes to have access to the `kubernetesConfig` configuration vectors exemplified in [examples/largeclusters/kubernetes.json](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/examples/largeclusters/kubernetes.json). As long as you are using a version of acs-engine `v0.3.0` or newer, your kubernetes cluster specification will fulfill this minimum version requirement.
- We recommend the use of smaller pools (e.g., count of 20) over larger pools (e.g., count of 100); produce your desired total node count with lots of pools, as opposed to as few as possible.
- We also recommend using large vmSize configurations to reduce node counts, where appropriate. Make sure you have a defensible infrastructure justification for more nodes in terms of node count (for example as of kubernetes 1.7 there is a 100 pods per node limit), instead of opting to use more powerful nodes. Doing so reduces cluster complexity, and azure resource administrative overhead. As Kubernetes excels in binpacking pods onto available instances, vertically scaling VM sizes (more CPU/RAM) is a better approach for expanding cluster capacity, if you are not approaching the pod-per-node limit.

## Backoff configuration options
The following configuration parameters are available in the `properties.orchestratorProfile.kubernetesConfig` configuration object in the api model specification:

```json
    "cloudProviderBackoff": {
      "value": "true" // if true, enable backoff
    },
    "cloudProviderBackoffDuration": {
      "value": "5" // how many seconds for initial backoff retry attempt
    },
    "cloudProviderBackoffExponent": {
      "value": "1.5" // exponent for successive backoff retries
    },
    "cloudProviderBackoffJitter": {
      "value": "1" // non-1 values add jitter to retry intervals
    },
    "cloudProviderBackoffRetries": {
      "value": "6" // maximum retry attempts before failure
    },
    "cloudProviderRatelimit": {
      "value": "false" // if true, enforce rate limits for azure API calls
    },
    "cloudProviderRatelimitBucket": {
      "value": "10" // number of requests in queue
    },
    "cloudProviderRatelimitQPS": {
      "value": "3" // rate limit QPS
    },
    "kubernetesCtrlMgrNodeMonitorGracePeriod": {
      "value": "5m" // duration after which controller manager marks an AWOL node as NotReady
    },
    "kubernetesCtrlMgrPodEvictionTimeout": {
      "value": "1m" // grace period for deleting pods on failed nodes
    },
    "kubernetesCtrlMgrRouteReconciliationPeriod": {
      "value": "1m" // how often to reconcile cloudprovider-originating node routes
    },
    "kubeletConfig": {
      "--node-status-update-frequency": "1m" // how often kubelet posts node status to master
    }
```
The [examples/largeclusters/kubernetes.json](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/examples/largeclusters/kubernetes.json) api model example suggests how you might opt into these large cluster features following the guidelines above.
