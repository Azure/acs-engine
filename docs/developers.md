# Developers Guide

This guide explains how to set up your environment for developing on
acs-engine.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.6.0 or later
- Glide 0.12.0 or later
- kubectl 1.5 or later
- An Azure account (needed for deploying VMs and Azure infrastructure)
- Git

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions. This project has set up some guidelines in
order to ensure that (a) code quality remains high, (b) the project
remains consistent, and (c) contributions follow the open source legal
requirements. Our intent is not to burden contributors, but to build
elegant and high-quality open source code so that our users will benefit.

Make sure you have read and understood the main CONTRIBUTING guide:

https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

### Structure of the Code

The code for the acs-engine project is organized as follows:

- The individual programs are located in `cmd/`. Code inside of `cmd/`
  is not designed for library re-use.
- Shared libraries are stored in `pkg/`.
- The `tests/` directory contains a number of utility scripts. Most of these
  are used by the CI/CD pipeline.
- The `docs/` folder is used for documentation and examples.

Go dependencies are managed with
[Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) and stored in the
`vendor/` directory.

### Git Conventions

We use Git for our version control system. The `master` branch is the
home of the current development candidate. Releases are tagged.

We accept changes to the code via GitHub Pull Requests (PRs). One
workflow for doing this is as follows:

1. Use `go get` to clone the acs-engine repository: `go get github.com/Azure/acs-engine`
2. Fork that repository into your GitHub account
3. Add your repository as a remote for `$GOPATH/github.com/Azure/acs-engine`
4. Create a new working branch (`git checkout -b feat/my-feature`) and
   do your work on that branch.
5. When you are ready for us to review, push your branch to GitHub, and
   then open a new pull request with us.

### Third Party Dependencies

Third party dependencies reside locally inside the repository under the `vendor/` directory. We use [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) to enforce our dependency graph, declared in [glide.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the project root.

If you wish to introduce a new third party dependency into `acs-engine`, please file an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/issues), and include the canonical VCS path (e.g., `github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go`) along with either the desired release string expression to depend on (e.g., `~8.1.0`), or the commit hash to pin to a static commit (e.g., `4cdb38c072b86bf795d2c81de50784d9fdd6eb77`). A project maintainer will then own the effort to update the codebase with that dependency, including relevant updates to `glide.yaml` and `vendor/`.

As a rule we want to distinguish dependency update PRs from feature/bug PRs; we may ask that feature/bug PRs which include updates to `vendor/` and/or contain any other dependency-related overhead to be triaged into separate PRs that can be managed independently, pre-requisite dependency changes in one, and features/bugs in another. The objective of enforcing these distinctions is to help focus the PR review process, and to make manageable the difficult task of rationalizing a multitude of parallel PRs in flight, many of which which may carry hard-to-reconcile dependency side-effects when aggressively updated with a fresh dependency graph as part of the PR payload.

### Go Conventions

We follow the Go coding style standards very closely. Typically, running
`go fmt` will make your code beautiful for you.

We also typically follow the conventions recommended by `go lint` and
`gometalinter`. Run `make test-style` to test the style conformance.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests may be run locally via `make test`.

### End-to-end Tests

End-to-end tests for the DCOS, Kubernetes and OpenShift orchestrators may be run
via `make test-{dcos,kubernetes,openshift}`.  The test process can optionally
deploy and tear down a cluster as part of the test (this is enabled by default).
You'll need access to an Azure subscription, as well as at least the following
environment variables to be set:

* `CLIENT_ID`: Azure client ID
* `CLIENT_SECRET`: Azure client secret
* `SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Azure subscription UUID
* `TENANT_ID`: Azure tenant UUID

#### OpenShift

To test the OpenShift orchestrator, you'll need to enable programmatic
deployment of the underlying image.  In the Azure console, find the image under
Home > New > Marketplace > Everything.  Click "Want to deploy programmatically?
Get started".  Enable your subscription and click Save.

You'll also need to have `oc` and `kubectl` binaries locally in your PATH which
correspond to the cluster version being tested.  Download the `oc` binary, then
make a symlink or copy of it and name the new file `kubectl`.

To have the test process deploy and tear down a cluster, set the following
environment variables:

* `CLUSTER_DEFINITION=examples/openshift.json`
* `DISTRO=openshift39_centos`
* `LOCATION=eastus`

Alternatively, to run tests on a pre-deployed OpenShift cluster, set the
following environment variables:

* `CLEANUP_ON_EXIT=false`
* `LOCATION=eastus`
* `NAME=`: dnsPrefix of the pre-deployed cluster

Finally, you'll need to make sure that the apimodel.json corresponding to the
pre-deployed cluster is available at `_output/$NAME.json`.  If you previously
used `acs-engine deploy` directly to deploy the cluster, you will need to run
`cp _output/$NAME/apimodel.json _output/$NAME.json`.
