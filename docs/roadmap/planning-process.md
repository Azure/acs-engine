# Planning Process

acs-engine features a lightweight process that emphasizes openness and ensures every community member can see project goals for the future.

## The Role of Maintainers

[Maintainers][] lead the acs-engine project. Their duties include proposing the Roadmap, reviewing and integrating contributions and maintaining the vision of the project.

## Open Roadmap

The [acs-engine Roadmap](roadmap.md) is a community document. While Maintainers propose the Roadmap, it gets discussed and refined in Release Planning Meetings.

## Contributing to the Roadmap

Proposals and issues can be opened by anyone. Every member of the community is welcome to participate in the discussion by providing feedback and/or offering counter-proposals.

## Release Milestones

The Roadmap gets delivered progressively via the [Release Schedule][].  Releases are defined during Release Planning Meetings and managed using GitHub Milestones which track specific deliverables and work-in-progress.

## Release Planning Meetings

Major decisions affecting the Roadmap are discussed during Release Planning Meetings on the first Thursday of each month, aligned with the [Release Schedule][] and monthly objectives for the Microsoft ACS team.

Release Planning Meetings are not currently open to non-Microsoft contributors, but we may change this in the future.
