# acs-engine Roadmap

The acs-engine Roadmap is a community document created as part of the
[Planning Process](planning-process.md). Each roadmap item describes a high-level capability or
grouping of features that are deemed important to the future of acs-engine.

Given the project's rapid [Release Schedule](releases.md), roadmap
items are designed to provide a sense of direction over many releases.
