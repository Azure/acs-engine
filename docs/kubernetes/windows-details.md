# More on Windows and Kubernetes

If you're trying to deploy Kubernetes with Windows the first time, be sure to check out the [quick start](windows.md) first. If you're looking for more details on deployments, examples or troubleshooting &mdash; read on.

## Customizing Windows deployments

ACS-Engine allows a lot more customizations available in the [docs](../), but here are a few important ones you should know for Windows deployments. Each of these are extra parameters you can add into the ACS-Engine apimodel file (such as `kubernetes-windows.json` from the quick start) before running `acs-engine generate`.

### Changing the OS disk size

The Windows Server deployments default to 30GB for the OS drive (C:), which is not enough to pull multiple `microsoft/windowsservercore`-based containers. It's easiest to start with 128GB, then see what your usage is over time before shrinking it down. You can change this size by adding `osDiskSizeGB` under the `agentPoolProfiles`, such as:

```json
"agentPoolProfiles": [
      {
        "name": "windowspool2",
        "count": 2,
        "vmSize": "Standard_D2_v3",
        "availabilityProfile": "AvailabilitySet",
        "osType": "Windows",
        "osDiskSizeGB": 128
     }
```

### Choosing the Windows Server version

If you want to deploy a specific Windows Server version, you can. First, find available versions with `az vm image list` command:

```
$ az vm image list --publisher MicrosoftWindowsServer --all -o table

Offer                    Publisher                      Sku                                             Urn                                                                                                            Version
-----------------------  -----------------------------  ----------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------
...
WindowsServerSemiAnnual  MicrosoftWindowsServer         Datacenter-Core-1709-with-Containers-smalldisk  MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServerSemiAnnual:Datacenter-Core-1709-with-Containers-smalldisk:1709.0.20180412  1709.0.20180412
WindowsServerSemiAnnual  MicrosoftWindowsServer         Datacenter-Core-1803-with-Containers-smalldisk  MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServerSemiAnnual:Datacenter-Core-1803-with-Containers-smalldisk:1803.0.20180504  1803.0.20180504
```

You can use the Offer, Publisher and Sku to pick a specific version by adding `windowsOffer`, `windowsPublisher`, `windowsSku` and (optionally) `windowsVersion` to the `windowsProfile` section. In this example, the latest Windows Server version 1803 image would be deployed.

```json
"windowsProfile": {
            "adminUsername": "azureuser",
            "adminPassword": "...",
            "windowsPublisher": "MicrosoftWindowsServer",
            "windowsOffer": "WindowsServerSemiAnnual",
            "windowsSku": "Datacenter-Core-1803-with-Containers-smalldisk"
     },
```

```

5. Create a pod with azure file pvc
```kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JiangtianLi/Examples/master/windows/azurefile/iis-azurefile.yaml```

6. Watch the status of pod until its `STATUS` is `Running`
```
kubectl get po/iis-azurefile -o wide -w
```

7. Enter the pod container to validate
```
kubectl exec -it iis-azurefile -- cmd
```

```
C:\>dir c:\mnt\azure
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is F878-8D74

 Directory of c:\mnt\azure

               2 Dir(s)   5,368,709,120 bytes free

```

### Using Azure Disks

This example is modified after https://github.com/andyzhangx/Demo/tree/master/windows/azuredisk/rs3

1. Create an azure disk storage class

option#1: k8s agent pool is based on blob disk VM
```kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JiangtianLi/Examples/master/windows/azuredisk/storageclass-azuredisk.yaml```

option#2: k8s agent pool is based on managed disk VM
```kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JiangtianLi/Examples/master/windows/azuredisk/storageclass-azuredisk-managed.yaml```

2. make sure storageclass is created successfully
```

watch kubectl get po/iis-azuredisk -o wide
```

7. Enter the pod container to validate
```
kubectl exec -it iis-azuredisk -- cmd
```


### Multiple containers in a POD

Copy this yaml to a file, then deploy it with `kubectl apply -f <filename.yaml>`

It will run 2 containers:

- iis-container: This is a basic static web server
- servercore-container: This will run a script that changes the index page every 10 seconds

Once deployed, you can load the web page and refresh it to see the contents changing.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: two-containers
  name: two-containers
spec:
  replicas: 1

          command: 
          - powershell.exe
          - -command 
          - "while ($true) { Start-Sleep -Seconds 10; Copy-Item -Path C:\\wwwcache\\iisstart.htm -Destination C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\iisstart.htm; }"

        - name: servercore-container
          image: microsoft/windowsservercore:1803
          volumeMounts:
          - name: shared-data
            mountPath: /poddata
          command: 
          - powershell.exe
          - -command 
          - "$i=0; while ($true) { Start-Sleep -Seconds 10; $msg = 'Hello from the servercore container, count is {0}' -f $i; Set-Content -Path C:\\poddata\\iisstart.htm -Value $msg; $i++; }"

      nodeSelector:

```


## Troubleshooting

Windows support is still in **active development** with many changes each week. Read on for known per-version issues and for help troubleshooting if you run into problems.

### Finding logs

To connect to a Windows node using Remote Desktop and get logs, please read over this topic in the main [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#connecting-to-windows-nodes) page first.

### Checking versions

Please be sure to include this info with any Windows bug reports.

Kubernetes
`kubectl version`
-	“Server Version”
`kubectl describe node <windows node>`
-	“kernel version”
-	Also note the IP Address for the next step, but you don't need to share it

The Azure CNI plugin version and configuration is stored in `C:\k\azurecni\netconf\10-azure.conflist`. Get
-	mode
-	dns.Nameservers
-	dns.Search

Get the Azure CNI build by running `C:\k\azurecni\bin\azure-vnet.exe --help`. It will dump some errors, but the version such as ` v1.0.4-1-gf0f090e` will be listed.

### Known Issues per Version


ACS-Engine | Windows Server |	Kubernetes | Azure CNI | Notes
-----------|----------------|------------|-----------|----------
V0.16.2	| Windows Server version 1709 (10.0.16299.____)	| V1.9.7 | ? | DNS resolution is not configured
V0.17.0 | Windows Server version 1709	| V1.10.2 | v1.0.4 | Acs-engine version 0.17 defaults to Windows Server version 1803. You can override it to use 1709 instead [here](#choosing-the-windows-server-version). Manual workarounds needed on Windows for DNS Server list, DNS search suffix
V0.17.0 | Windows Server version 1803 (10.0.17134.1) | V1.10.2 | v1.0.4 | Manual workarounds needed on Windows for DNS Server list, DNS search suffix, and dropped packets
v0.17.1 | Windows Server version 1709 | v1.10.3 | v1.0.4-1-gf0f090e | Manual workarounds needed on Windows for DNS Server list and DNS search suffix. This ACS-Engine version defaults to Windows Server version 1803, but you can override it to use 1709 instead [here](#choosing-the-windows-server-version)
v0.18.3 | Windows Server version 1803 | v1.10.3 | v1.0.6 | Pods cannot resolve cluster DNS names
v0.20.9 | Windows Server version 1803 | v1.10.6 | v1.0.11 | Pods cannot resolve cluster DNS names

### Known problems

#### Packets from Windows pods are dropped

Affects: Windows Server version 1803 (10.0.17134.1)

Issues: https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/issues/3037 

There is a problem with the “L2Tunnel” networking mode not forwarding packets correctly specific to Windows Server version 1803. Windows Server version 1709 is not affected.

Workarounds:
**Fixes are still in development.** A Windows hotfix is needed, and will be deployed by ACS-Engine once it's ready. The hotfix will be removed later when it's in a future cumulative rollup.


#### Pods cannot resolve public DNS names

Affects: Some builds of Azure CNI

Issues: https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/issues/147

Run `ipconfig /all` in a pod, and check that the first DNS server listed is within your cluster IP range (10.x.x.x). If it's not listed, or not the first in the list, then an azure-cni update is needed.

Workaround:

1.	Get the kube-dns service IP with `kubectl get svc -n kube-system kube-dns`
2.  Cordon & drain the node
3.	Modify `C:\k\azurecni\netconf\10-azure.conflist` and make it the first entry under Nameservers
4.  Uncordon the node

Example:
```
{
    "cniVersion":  "0.3.0",
    "name":  "azure",
    "plugins":  [
                    {
                        "type":  "azure-vnet",
                        "mode":  "tunnel",
                        "bridge":  "azure0",
                        "ipam":  {
                                     "type":  "azure-vnet-ipam"
                                 },
                        "dns":  {
                                    "Nameservers":  [
                                                        "10.0.0.10",
                                                        "168.63.129.16"
                                                    ],
                                    "Search":  [
                                                   "default.svc.cluster.local"
                                               ]
                                },
…
```

#### Pods cannot resolve cluster DNS names

Affects: Azure CNI plugin <= 0.3.0

Issues: https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/issues/146

If you can't resolve internal service names within the same namespace, run `ipconfig /all` in a pod, and check that the DNS Suffix Search List matches the form `<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`. An Azure CNI update is needed to set the right DNS suffix.

Workaround:
1.	Use the FQDN in DNS lookups such as `kubernetes.kube-system.svc.cluster.local`
2.	Instead of DNS, use environment variables `* _SERVICE_HOST` and `*_SERVICE_PORT` to find service IPs and ports in the same namespace


#### Pods cannot ping default route or internet IPs

Affects: All clusters deployed by acs-engine

ICMP traffic is not routed between private Azure vNETs or to the internet.

Workaround: test network connections with another protocol (TCP/UDP). For example `Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing https://www.azure.com` or `curl https://www.azure.com`.



## Cluster Troubleshooting

If your cluster is not reachable, you can run the following command to check for common failures.

### Misconfigured Service Principal

If your Service Principal is misconfigured, none of the Kubernetes components will come up in a healthy manner.
You can check to see if this the problem:

```shell
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa USER@MASTERFQDN sudo journalctl -u kubelet | grep --text autorest
```

If you see output that looks like the following, then you have **not** configured the Service Principal correctly.
You may need to check to ensure the credentials were provided accurately, and that the configured Service Principal has
read and **write** permissions to the target Subscription.
