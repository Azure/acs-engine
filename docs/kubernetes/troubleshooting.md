## Troubleshooting

### Scaling up or down

Scaling your cluster up or down requires different parameters and template than the create. More details here [Scale up](../../examples/scale-up/README.md)

If your cluster is not reachable, you can run the following command to check for common failures.

### Misconfigured Service Principal

If your Service Principal is misconfigured, none of the Kubernetes components will come up in a healthy manner.
You can check to see if this the problem:

```shell
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa USER@MASTERFQDN sudo journalctl -u kubelet | grep --text autorest
```

If you see output that looks like the following, then you have **not** configured the Service Principal correctly.
You may need to check to ensure the credentials were provided accurately, and that the configured Service Principal has
read and **write** permissions to the target Subscription.
