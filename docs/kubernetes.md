## Known Issues

### Node "NotReady" due to lost TCP connection

Nodes might appear in the "NotReady" state for approx. 15 minutes if master stops receiving updates from agents.
This is a known upstream kubernetes [issue #41916](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/41916#issuecomment-312428731). This fixing PR is currently under review.

ACS-Engine partially mitigates this issue on Linux by detecting dead TCP connections more quickly via **net.ipv4.tcp_retries2=8**.
