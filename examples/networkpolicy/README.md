# Microsoft Azure Container Service Engine - Network Policy

## Overview

> The Azure VNET network policy for Linux containers is currently available as **public preview** for Kubernetes. Support for Windows containers and other orchestrators is coming soon.

These cluster definition examples demonstrate how to create customized Docker enabled clusters with Azure VNET network policy.

1. **kubernetes-azure.json** - deploying and using [Kubernetes](../../docs/kubernetes.md) with Azure VNET network policy.
2. **kubernetes-azure-hybrid.json** - deploying and using [Kubernetes](../../docs/kubernetes.md) with both Linux and Windows agent pools and Azure VNET network policy.
