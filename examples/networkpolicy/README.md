# Microsoft Azure Container Service Engine - Network Policy

## Overview

The kubernetes-calico deployment template enables Calico networking and policies for the ACS-engine cluster via `"networkPolicy": "calico"` being present inside the `kubernetesConfig`.

```
  "properties": {
    "orchestratorProfile": {
      "orchestratorType": "Kubernetes",
      "kubernetesConfig": {
        "networkPolicy": "calico"
      }
```

If `"orchestratorRelease": "1.8",` is set a K8s 1.8.x cluster will be provisioned.  If `orchestratorRelease` is not specified a K8s 1.7.x cluster will be deployed.  In either of these cases, this template will deploy the [v2.6.1 release](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v2.6/releases/) of [Kubernetes Datastore Install](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v2.6/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/kubernetes-datastore/) version of calico with the "Calico policy-only with user-supplied networking" which supports kubernetes ingress policies and has some limitations as denoted on the referenced page.  

> Note: If deploying on a K8s 1.8 cluster, then egress policies are also supported!

If `orchestratorRelease` is set to 1.5 or 1.6, then this template will deploy the [v2.4.1 release](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/releases/tag/v2.4.1) of [Kubernetes Datastore Install](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v2.4/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/kubernetes-datastore/) version of calico with the "Calico policy-only with user-supplied networking" which supports kubernetes ingress policies and has some limitations as denoted on the referenced page.

To understand how to deploy this template, please read the baseline  [Kubernetes](../../docs/kubernetes.md) document and simply make sure to use the **kubernetes-calico.json** file in this folder which has the above referenced line to enable.

## Post installation

Once the template has been successfully deployed, following the [simple policy tutorial](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v2.6/getting-started/kubernetes/tutorials/simple-policy) will help to understand calico networking.

> Note: `ping` (ICMP) traffic is blocked on the cluster by default.  Wherever `ping` is used in any tutorial substitute testing access with something like `wget -q --timeout=5 google.com -O -` instead.
